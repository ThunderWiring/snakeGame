3 files i had  written:

1)SnakeGame.cpp: this one has the main() function for driving the whole game thing..
2)grid.h: this header handles the board of the game: has the data-structure for the board
	   and other functions to handle this structure
3)utilities.h: includes classes for snake and the board and another class
		to handle the movement of the objects(i.e the snake)
========================================================================
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named SnakeGame.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

========================================================================
Other notes:

1)AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
  should add to or customize.

2)and if you are not using Visual Studio, remove the "#pragma region" and "#pragma endregion" 
  lines wherever they are being used, so that the code would compile..
